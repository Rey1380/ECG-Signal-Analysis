# ECG-Signal-Analysis
In this MATLAB code main characteristics of a normal ecg (electrocardiogram) were measured. <br/>
These characteristics are:<br/>
1.RR interval<br/>
2.R peak<br/>
In normal ecg these characteristics are in an specific range.<br/>
By considering these items in our input ecg we can recognize if the signal is for a patient or a healthy person.<br/>
We can also recognize some heart disease in our program.<br/>
We use some statistic characteristics like Mean, Variance and Kurtosis of signal to identify which type of disease is occurred.<br/>
Some disease like Arrhythmia, Bradycardia and Tachycardia could be detected just by considering their R peak duration<br/>
but, some more complicated disease could be detected by more characteristics like P wave and T wave that we didn't consider them.<br/>
Some disease couldn't be identified even with these ways and they need more experiments to be identified.<br/>
